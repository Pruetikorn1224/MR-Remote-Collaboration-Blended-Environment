# Blended Environment in Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration: User Interaction Experiment

Recently, mixed reality technology has been integrated into remote collaboration systems, with numerous researchers developing different approaches to enable interactions between local and remote users within a mixed reality platform. These studies have facilitated collaborative scenarios by aligning objects from remote environments with those in the user's local environment to enhance accessibility. This study aims to determine the most effective method of blending environments from two users' rooms across three different conditions.
